cool, lets me a plan for teh backend to first do the api calls for 6 Specialized Agents: Twitter, TikTok, Reddit, Google Trends, Web Search, Analyst

after that create to one or more llms to generate real reasponse. 

lets chat about this plan first before doing any actions. create a document for steps and quick onboarding if i want to start a chat here #file:docs 

ask me if you have any questions




Great! Let's plan the real API integration strategy. Before I create the document, I have some important questions to help design the best approach:

🔍 Questions About API Integration
1. API Access & Credentials
Do you already have API keys for any of these services?
Twitter/X API (Developer account?)
Reddit API (App credentials?)
TikTok Research API (Business account?)
Bing Search API or Google Custom Search?
Should I plan for free tier limitations or paid tiers?
2. Azure OpenAI Setup
Do you have an Azure OpenAI resource already deployed?
If yes: What's the deployment name? (gpt-4, gpt-35-turbo, etc.)
If no: Should I include Azure setup instructions?
Alternative: Should we support OpenAI API directly (non-Azure) as fallback?
Budget considerations for API calls?
3. LLM Strategy
You mentioned "one or more llms" - what's your preference?

Option A: Single LLM for all tasks (analysis + report generation)
Option B: Multiple LLMs with different roles:
Fast model (GPT-3.5) for data summarization
Advanced model (GPT-4) for insights and reports
Option C: Different providers (Azure OpenAI + Anthropic Claude)?
4. Data Collection Priority
Which agents are most critical for your use case?

Must-have: Which 2-3 are essential?
Nice-to-have: Which can wait or use mock data?
This helps prioritize implementation order
5. Rate Limits & Caching
Should we implement caching to reduce API calls?
Cache duration: 1 hour? 24 hours?
Rate limiting strategy per API?
Batch processing for multiple requests?
6. Error Handling
If one API fails (e.g., Twitter quota exceeded), should we:
Continue with other sources?
Use cached/mock data as fallback?
Notify user and partial results?
7. Development Approach
Incremental: Implement one API at a time, test, then move to next?
Parallel: Set up all APIs simultaneously?
Hybrid: Core APIs first (Twitter, Reddit, LLM), then add others?
8. Testing & Validation
Do you want a test suite for each API connector?
Separate dev/staging API keys from production?
Should mock data remain available for testing without using API quota?
9. Configuration Management
How should credentials be managed?
Environment variables (current approach)?
Secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)?
Config files with encryption?
10. Deployment Environment
Where will this run in production?
Local development only?
Cloud deployment (Railway, Render, AWS)?
Docker containers?
This affects how we handle credentials and networking
📋 Proposed Document Structure
Based on your needs, I'm thinking of creating:

backend/docs/STEP10_REAL_API_INTEGRATION.md with:

Overview & Prerequisites
API Setup Guides (one section per service)
Twitter/X API
Reddit API
TikTok Research API
Google Trends
Bing/Google Search
Azure OpenAI Configuration
LLM Integration Strategy
Implementation Steps (ordered by priority)
Testing Each Connector
Environment Configuration
Migration from Mock to Real Data
Cost Estimation & Optimization
Troubleshooting Guide
Plus a quick reference:
backend/docs/API_CREDENTIALS_TEMPLATE.md - Template for .env file

Let me know your answers to these questions, and I'll create a comprehensive, actionable plan tailored to your specific needs! 🚀




1 i might have some but if i dont' i'll create them one by one you can also help me to tell where i should look for it.
2 i'm not sure if i want only use azure, i might want to use 2 or more llms from google or azure or aws or snowflake etc and give option on frontend to call on which llm but lets frist sort out all the api calls and then work on llms. 

3 option c differennt providers and different models but will start with one and then expand. 

4 will do all the api calls one by one and then sort out the llms. 

5 yes caching for now and adding to db for later. 

6 we should be transparent and say which api call failed and then continure and provide result based on the collected and available data.

7 lets do inceremental. so first i want to make sure i can get my data from APIs first . 

8 lets do api and validation for each api call and do best practice. 

9 current approach is fine for now

10 this is an mvp so it will be local or staging server later. lets focus to make sure we can running properly on codespaces first. 

i aggree with yoru proposed document. 

do you have more questions?


Perfect! Your answers are clear and practical. I have just a few more clarifying questions before creating the comprehensive plan:

🎯 Final Clarification Questions
API Data Collection Strategy
11. Data Volume & Quality

For each API call, what's a reasonable target?
Twitter: 15-50 tweets? More?
Reddit: 50-100 posts/comments?
TikTok: How many videos/posts?
Google Trends: Just search volume data, or also related queries?
Web Search: 50-100 URLs/snippets?
Should we prioritize recent data (last 7 days) or high engagement (most popular)?
12. Search Query Strategy

Current mock uses simple keywords (e.g., "Gen Z Nigeria Facebook")
For real APIs, should we:
Use exact search terms from research questions?
Auto-expand with related terms/hashtags?
Include date ranges in queries?
Filter by language/region?
13. TikTok Specific

TikTok doesn't have a public search API like Twitter/Reddit
Options:
TikTok Research API (requires business account, limited access)
TikTok Creative Center API (trends data, more accessible)
Web scraping (against ToS, not recommended)
Skip for MVP and use mock data only?
What's your preference?
LLM Integration (Brief, since we'll detail later)
14. LLM Selection Priority

Which provider should we implement first for testing?
Azure OpenAI (GPT-4)
Google Gemini
AWS Bedrock (Claude)
Snowflake Cortex
This will be Step 11 after all APIs are working
15. Frontend LLM Selector

Should users pick LLM before starting research, or can they:
Run research with default LLM
Re-analyze same data with different LLM later?
This affects architecture (store raw data vs just final report)
Implementation Order
16. Incremental API Priority
Based on "must-have" for your use case, suggest this order:

Twitter/X (most structured data, good API)
Reddit (rich discussions, good API)
Google Trends (quick to implement)
Bing/Google Search (web intelligence)
TikTok (skip or use Creative Center API)
Azure OpenAI (for real analysis)
Does this order work, or would you prefer different priority?

Testing Strategy
17. API Testing Approach

Should I create a test script (test_api_connectors.py) that:
Tests each API independently
Validates response format
Checks rate limits
Measures response time
This helps verify credentials before integrating?
18. Cost Monitoring

Should we add API call counters/logging to track:
Number of requests per API
Estimated cost per research session
Quota usage warnings
Helps manage free tier limits?

11 we should probably see what the api allow us , becasue i'm targeting free apis so probably have to see where they allow us to get for free. 

12 probably yes to all 

13 lets see what i've allowed for it. i havent' create tiktop yet. 

14 not sure right now, probably Gemini 

15 lets go simple, just pick up llm before starting research for now

16 i agree with your suggestion 

17 yes i agree

18 probably yes, bu lets do it simple for now 

do you have more questions?
